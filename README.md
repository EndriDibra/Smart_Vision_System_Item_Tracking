# Smart_Vision_System_Item_Tracking
This is a 3Day-Challenge Project for my Interview at Lyngsoe-Systems Company. It is about a smart item tracking system, incorporating computer vision and Voice technology.
More spesifically i make use of computer vision libraries such as OpenCV and pyzbar, to detect and read QR and Bar codes of items/products. Then, i store them into a .csv dataset, as well as displaying them into a simple UI [User Interface] using Python-Flask and HTML5-CSS3-JS. Ultimately, i include voice technology for Speech-to-Text and Text-to-Speech, to enchance HCI [Human-Computer-Interaction], by allowing to the user to ask for a specific item/product about its status or location, and the system to respond accordingly.
